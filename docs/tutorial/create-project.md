# Creating a Project

The fastest way to start a new EFES-NG Prototype project is with the built-in project generator. It creates a ready-to-build project with all the necessary files and directory structure.

> [!warning] Work in Progress
> The GUI-integrated project generator is not yet available. For now, use the command-line scaffolding tool:
>
> ```bash
> npx create-efes-ng my-sigidoc-project
> ```
>
> The wizard will ask you to:
> 1. Name your project
> 2. Choose a project type (EpiDoc with SigiDoc stylesheets)
> 3. Confirm the stylesheet repository to clone

## What Just Happened?

The generator created a project directory with this structure:

```
my-sigidoc-project/
├── pipeline.xml                    # Pipeline definition
├── source/
│   ├── stylesheets/
│   │   ├── sigidoc/                # SigiDoc stylesheets (cloned)

::: details What are all these files?
- **`pipeline.xml`** — defines the processing steps that transform your XML into a website (more on this shortly)
- **`source/stylesheets/sigidoc/`** — the upstream SigiDoc XSLT stylesheets, cloned from the official repository
- **`source/stylesheets/lib/`** — framework-provided XSLT stylesheets that glue everything together
- **`source/stylesheets/overrides.xsl`** — a place for your project-specific XSLT overrides (empty by default)
- **`source/translations/`** — translation files for UI labels in the EpiDoc/SigiDoc XSLT output (e.g., "Material", "Type", "Dating")
- **`source/website/`** — the website template: HTML layouts, CSS, and the homepage
- **`source/indices-config.xsl`** — configures which metadata fields to extract for indices and search
- **`source/authority/`** — will hold your controlled vocabulary XML files (geography, bibliography, etc.)

> [!tip]
> The project structure is flexible — you can organize your source files however you like. But we recommend following this structure, which is what the documentation and examples use.

## First Build

Let's build the project to see what we have. Open the project folder in the EFES-NG Prototype desktop application and click **Start**.

The pipeline will run through its steps and generate the website. Once complete, click **Preview** to open it in your browser.

You should see a generic site with a header, navigation, and footer — but no content yet. That's expected: we haven't added any XML source documents.

Next, let's understand what the pipeline is doing — [Exploring the Project →](./explore-project)
